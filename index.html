        <h2>PLEASE READ EVERYTHING</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            inclusivity is mandatory or you will be asked to leave and will be excluded from future
            events
          </li>
          <li>any toxic behavior will not be tolerated</li>
          <li>respect people's boundaries</li>
          <li>
            be mindful of people's bubble, some of us are still scared of covid and/or interactions
            at all
          </li>
          <li>
            if you are not fully vaccinated against covid, wear a mask or stay two meters away from
            people
          </li>
          <li>
            don't come in big groups to avoid attention, park your bike/car away from the location
          </li>
          <li>don't post the location on public media, tell people to dm the instagram page</li>
          <li>dispose of your cans/bottles/bags in the recyling bags around the party</li>
          <li>
            if the cops show up don't run or yell, the organizer will deal with it. Feel free to
            leave if you want to, but do so calmly.
          </li>
          <li>
            we have a plan b location, if we do have to move depending on how late it is we will go
            there
          </li>
